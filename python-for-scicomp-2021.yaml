- workshop_title: Python for Scientific Computing 2021
- workshop_description: >
    Python for Scientific Computing is a bridge between basic Python
    courses and scientific work with Python.  This is a
    basic to intermediate course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
    Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It also covers some more advanced tools,
    such as Binder, releasing software, data formats, etc.  It is
    suitable for people who have a basic understanding of Python
    and want to know some internals and important libraries for
    science.  We don't cover anything in too much depth, but we do
    introduce you to all of the main tools you will need.


    This course was put on as a collaboration between partners in
    Finland, Norway, and Sweden, coordinated by Aalto Scientific
    Computing.

  title: Jupyter
  description: >-
    We discuss Jupyter, its advantages and disadvantages, and how to
    use it.  Our main focus is establishing a common ground for our
    main way of doing demos for the rest of the course, we don't go
    too deep.

  title: Numpy
  description: >-
    Numpy is the standard Python array package.  It provides not only
    the basic data structure, but also plenty of operations on this
    data.  By using built-in functions, many operations can be
    vectorized and made much faster (just like they are done in any
    other high-level numerical language).  Many other scientific and
    numerical packages are build using Numpy, so it is very important
    to learn to use it well.

  title: Pandas 1/2
  description: >-
    Pandas is the standard tabular data package for Python.  It allows
    you to do plenty of operations quickly and seamlessly.  In this
    lesson, we go over the basics of using Pandas.  After this lesson,
    you won't know everything but you will be able to read the docs
    and figure out from more yourself, which is what almost everyone
    has to do anyway.

  title: Visualizaiton
  description: >-
    Generating figures is part of the scientific process.  This should
    not be manual, but ideally they should be automatically generated in
    final form.  This makes your work reproducible, getting around
    "oh no I can't make it again" problems.

    In this lesson, we discuss the matplotlib Python library which can
    be used to make figures like this.  This isn't the only Python
    tool, and may not even be the best one, but it is the base of many
    other tools and a good point to learn the basic concepts you will
    apply over and over.

  title: Data formats
  description: >-

    Input/output bandwidth is just as much a consumable resource as
    CPU or memory.  And data formats are important for both ease
    (human effort) and time taken to read data.  Here, we will go over
    the basic concepts and some important data formats which you may
    need in your work.
