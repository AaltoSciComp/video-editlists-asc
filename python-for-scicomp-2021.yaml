- workshop_title: Python for Scientific Computing 2021
- workshop_description: >
    Python for Scientific Computing is a bridge between basic Python
    courses and scientific work with Python.  This is a
    medium-advanced course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
    Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It also covers some more advanced tools,
    such as Binder, releasing software, data formats, etc.  It is
    suitable for people who have a basic understanding of Python
    and want to know some internals and important libraries for
    science.  We don't cover anything in too much depth, but we do
    introduce you to all of the main tools you will need.


    This course was put on as a collaboration between partners in
    Finland, Norway, and Sweden, coordinated by Aalto Scientific
    Computing.

  title: Jupyter
  description: >-
    We discuss Jupyter, its advantages and disadvantages, and how to
    use it.  Our main focus is establishing a common ground for our
    main way of doing demos for the rest of the course, we don't go
    too deep.

  title: Numpy
  description: >-
    Numpy is the standard Python array package.  It provides not only
    the basic data structure, but also plenty of operations on this
    data.  By using built-in functions, many operations can be
    vectorized and made much faster (just like they are done in any
    other high-level numerical language).  Many other scientific and
    numerical packages are build using Numpy, so it is very important
    to learn to use it well.

  title: Pandas 1/2
  description: >-
    Pandas is the standard tabular data package for Python.  It allows
    you to do plenty of operations quickly and seamlessly.  In this
    lesson, we go over the basics of using Pandas.  After this lesson,
    you won't know everything but you will be able to read the docs
    and figure out from more yourself, which is what almost everyone
    has to do anyway.
