- workshop_title: Python for Scientific Computing 2021
- workshop_description: >

    Python for Scientific Computing is a bridge between basic Python
    courses and scientific work with Python.  This is a
    medium-advanced course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
    Matplotlib, and Pandas. It is suitable for people who have a basic
    understanding of basic Python and want to know some internals and
    important libraries for science.  We don't cover anything in too
    much depth, but we do introduce you to all of the main tools you
    will need.
