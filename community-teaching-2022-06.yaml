  title: Community teaching workshop (intro), 2022 June - CodeRefinery
  description: >-
    In 2020, we got farther from our offices but closer to each
    other. If you could adapt to the circumstances, a huge number of
    possibilities were opened - in particular with collaborative
    teaching. In this training, you will learn how we use
    them. Teaching from 2019 is almost obsolete - join us to learn
    more.

    Teaching is a profession, but also something that everyone needs
    to be able to do to some degree, since everyone has their own
    personal specialties they will either teach or mentor.

    Broadly, this covers:

    - Tools of teaching: how to make the most out of online (and other) teaching.

    - Workshop organization, collaboratively: our vision of teaching together outside of our silos.

    - Socio-technical factors: social and technical barriers to learning, why you need to care, and what you can do about them.

    - Lesson development, collaboratively: how to design lessons and teaching materials so that they can be open and shared.


    This is the first hour of a three-hour workshop.
