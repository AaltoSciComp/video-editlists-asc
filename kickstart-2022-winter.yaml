  title: "1.1 Me and HPC or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the computing"
  description: >-
    Are you at the start of your scientific computing journey?

    Would you like to hear tips and tricks from someone who knows what
    they are doing, but still remembers what it was like to be a
    newbie?

    In this talk a we will get a personal views of high-performance
    computing from a final year PhD student and one of our staff
    scientists.
