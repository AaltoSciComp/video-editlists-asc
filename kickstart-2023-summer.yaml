    This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started
    with Scientific Computing" and "HPC Kickstart"
    workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most
    useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review
    later.

  title: "1.1 From data storage to your science"
  description: >-
    Data is how most computational work starts, whether it is
    externally collected, simulation code, or generated. And these
    days, you can work on data even remotely, and these workflows
    aren't obvious. We discuss how data storage choices lead to
    computational workflows.

  description: >-
    In workshops such as this, you will hear lots about parallel
    computing and how you need it, but rarely get a understandable
    introduction to how they relate and which are right for you. Here,
    we give a understandable metaphor with preparing large meals.

  title: "1.4 How you actually install software on the cluster: an example case (Conda and Python)"
  description: >-
    Software installation is one of the questions we most often
    get. Usually, on clusters, this happens via environments, which
    allows you to install specific software per-project. Weâ€™ll give a
    demonstration of how these work in Python. Materials for demo:
    Python environments with Conda.

  description: >-
    Remembering server address... Another login? Another password
    prompt? Again? Wouldn't it be nice to just have a key instead of a
    keycode that you need to type in? Here, we will show you how to
    set up your computer to easily connect to the server(s) you
    need. And we will explain the process from keys to config. While
    useful, this part is skippable if you are able to connect to
    Triton (next section).

  description: >-
    Instead of talking about the steps, we show a complete example of
    an "array job".  We go too fast for anyone to follow along, but it
    shows what you will be able to do at the end of the course.

    This particular examples uses array jobs to run split one job into
    many, which is a common form of parallelism.  Array jobs:

  description: >-
    A real example of running a job using MPI on a cluster (LAMMPS in
    particular).  We go from files online to downloading the files to
    doing initial tests to running with multiple processors.  Again,
    this is too fast to follow along but shows you what we will get to
    on day 3.

    This example didn't work out so well, so maybe it's best as an
    example of how things usually go wrong and you have to solve the
    problems!

  description: >-
    Before we get to scripted jobs (like most people use on the
    cluster), we will talk about interactive jobs.  This lets us get a
    little bit familiar with the Slurm system.  You shouldn't use this
    for running real calculations, but for testing and debugging, it is
    very useful.

  title: 2.6 Monitoring jobs (summary)
  description: >-
    In order to use large amounts of resources, you need to be able to
    monitor how many resources you used, so that you can properly adjust
    the resources you request later.  We go over the main parts: output
    during the job, time, memory efficiency, CPU efficiency, GPU
    efficiency, and so on.

    We have already seen most of the content there, but we summarize
    everything now in one place.

  title: 2.7 Other topics (modules, storage, remote data)
  description: >-
    There are several things we don't go into detail about: the
    "module" command, data storage, and remote access to data.  This
    is the intro to these sections, and the actual videos come next.

    1) "module" is the command you use to make more software available.
    Here, we go over the idea behind it, but mainly we leave it to
    you to read the tutorial page.

    https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/modules/

    2) We go over data storage on the cluster: why it is important, main
    considerations, where to store it, and so on.  We only give a bit of
    discussion, and leave you to read for the details.

    https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/storage/

    3) You have data on the cluster, but you need to be able to access it
    from outside, or copy new data to the cluster.  This can be
    surprisingly frustrating, so we discuss transferring data vs
    mounting a remote filesystem for transparent access.

  description: >-
    Parallel computing is what HPC is really all about: processing
    things on more than one processor at once. By now, you should have
    read all of the previous tutorials.  Here, we learn about the
    different parallel paradigms (shared memory, message passing,
    OpenMP, MPI, array jobs, etc.) and see how they are used and
    configured in Slurm.
