  description: >
     This is a crash course on concepts related to high-performance
     computing.  We cover a lot of concepts here, but we don\'t go in
     depth.  We will see how this actually applies on days 2 and 3.

    One of our "preparations" was to request that you watch two videos
    from our winter kickstart course (Jan-Feb 2021).  Here, we explain
    a little bit about why we asked you to do these and what the
    contents of the videos are.

    The two videos are:
    Basic Linux shell and scripting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESXLbtaxpdI
    Scientific Computing Workflows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExFbc5EikU0

  title: Git crash course
  description: >-
     A version control system tracks changes to files, and is very
     important in most computational work.  Despite being so important,
     it often isn\'t taught.

     We don\'t try to teach it here: we don\'t have time.  Instead, we
     try to give a good enough intro so that you can follow along
     minimally when we use git tomorrow, and give you enough of an
     example and discussion so that you are well equipped to learn more later.

     CodeRefinery (https://coderefinery.org/) provides good courses
     for git and more multiple times a year.  Their latest course is
     online, just like this course.

     and what kind of support you can find.

- output: day2-asking-for-help.mkv
  title: How to ask for help
  description: >
     This talk is about how we can all improve the dialogue between supercomputer user community and staff. How to formulate support requests to get a useful answer and how to approach problems to find solutions sooner. But it is also aiming at support staff so that we always remain respectful and try to learn and solve problems together.

     During this talk, the Fastly CDN went down and broke a lot of the
     internet.  We left that discussion in there because it was a bit
     interesting at the time, and hopefully you can be entertained by
     it now.

     Cluster data storage systems, including the reason storage is
     important, remote mounting, scp, and sshfs.  Note that scp is not a
     good tool to use anymore, use rsync instead.

  title: Monitoring jobs
  description: >
     Once you run a job, you really need to see how it went: is it
     using resources efficiently?  You have to constantly check these
     things in order to make sure the code works well.

- output: day3-parallel.mkv
  title: Parallel jobs
  description: >
     Parallel jobs let you run code that uses more than one processor core,
     within one process or run.  It is a matter of understanding how
     the code works and giving the right options to Slurm.  But, that
     bit about understanding how the code uses the processors can be
     quite difficult if the code isn't documented well.
