    This is the starting discussion before the workshop gets started.

  description: >
     This is a crash course on concepts related to high-performance
     computing.  We cover a lot of concepts here, but we don\'t go in
     depth.  We will see how this actually applies on days 2 and 3.

    One of our "preparations" was to request that you watch two videos
    from our winter kickstart course (Jan-Feb 2021).  Here, we explain
    a little bit about why we asked you to do these and what the
    contents of the videos are.

    The two videos are:
    Basic Linux shell and scripting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESXLbtaxpdI
    Scientific Computing Workflows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExFbc5EikU0

  title: Git crash course
  description: >-
     A version control system tracks changes to files, and is very
     important in most computational work.  Despite being so important,
     it often isn\'t taught.

     We don\'t try to teach it here: we don\'t have time.  Instead, we
     try to give a good enough intro so that you can follow along
     minimally when we use git tomorrow, and give you enough of an
     example and discussion so that you are well equipped to learn more later.

     CodeRefinery (https://coderefinery.org/) provides good courses
     for git and more multiple times a year.  Their latest course is
     online, just like this course.

  title: Your future in scientific computing.
  description: >-
     This course is just your starting point.  Here, we go over what
     you might expect for the future: what other kinds of courses
     might be relevant, how you might need to continue your education,
     and what kind of support you can find.
