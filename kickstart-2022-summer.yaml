    This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started
    with Scientific Computing" and "HPC Kickstart"
    workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most
    useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review
    later.

  title: "1.1 From data storage to your science"
  description: >-
    Data is how most computational work starts, whether it is
    externally collected, simulation code, or generated. And these
    days, you can work on data even remotely, and these workflows
    aren’t obvious. We discuss how data storage choices lead to
    computational workflows.

  title: 1.2 What is parallel computing?  An analogy with cooking.
  description: >-
    In workshops such as this, you will hear lots about parallel
    computing and how you need it, but rarely get a understandable
    introduction to how they relate and which are right for you. Here,
    we give a understandable metaphor with preparing large meals.

  description: >-
    Remembering server address… Another login? Another password
    prompt? Again? Wouldn’t it be nice to just have a key instead of a
    keycode that you need to type in? Here, we will show you how to
    set up your computer to easily connect to the server(s) you
    need. And we will explain the process from keys to config. While
    useful, this part is skippable if you are able to connect to
    Triton (next section).

#
#    This particular examples uses array jobs to run split one job into

#    Before we get to scripted jobs (like most people use on the

#    little bit familiar with the Slurm system.  You shouldn't use this
#    for running real calculations, but for testing and debugging, it is

#  description: >-
#    In order to use large amounts of resources, you need to be able to
#    monitor how many resources you used, so that you can properly adjust
#    the resources you request later.  We go over the main parts: output
#    during the job, time, memory efficiency, CPU efficiency, GPU
#    efficiency, and so on.

#    everything now in one place.

#  description: >-
#    You have data on the cluster, but you need to be able to access it
#    from outside, or copy new data to the cluster.  This can be
#    surprisingly frustrating, so we discuss transferring data vs
#    mounting a remote filesystem for transparent access.

#    Parallel computing is what HPC is really all about: processing
#    things on more than one processor at once. By now, you should have
#    read all of the previous tutorials.  Here, we learn about the
#    different parallel paradigms (shared memory, message passing,
#    OpenMP, MPI, array jobs, etc.) and see how they are used and
#    configured in Slurm.
